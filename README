Net::Session
===========

I wrote these classes as I needed to access other sites with login information
and post files and other information.

Please be advised that I've not done a whole lot of testing on this library (as
evidenced by the lack of meaningful specs), and so you use this library completely
at your own risk!   I've not tested it on anything but Ruby 1.8.7, please let me
know if it works on other Ruby versions. Patches and (nice) suggestions are
always welcome!
