Net::Session
===========

I wrote these classes as I needed to access other sites with login information
and post files and other information.

Please be advised that I've not done a whole lot of testing on this library (as
evidenced by the utter lack of specs), and so you use this library completely at
your own risk!  Eventually I will get around to testing all of this, but for the
moment I'm just getting it "out there." I've extracted the code from a project
on which I am currently working, and I've not tested this gem - so it may not
work at all. I will be testing and updating this as I find the time.  I've also
not tested it on anything but Ruby 1.8.7. Patches and (nice) suggestions are
always welcome!
